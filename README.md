<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to develop a virtual assistant similar to Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant, that can perform various tasks on your system just by listening to your voice commands. 
<ul>
  <li>
The BOT can do various things on your system. Some of the major functionalities are
  </li>
  <li>
Playing song and movie of your choice.
  </li>
  <li>
Search for anything on wikipedia and google
  </li>
  <li>
Getting the news headlines
  </li>
  <li>
Youtube and google chrome automation, also it can open any link for you in the browser
  </li>
  <li>
Getting the weather forecast and Corona cases report of any country in the world.
  </li>
  <li>
It can also send Email and whatsapp messages for you.
  </li>
  <li>
Can run some applications installed on your system like chrome, vs code etc.
  </li>
  <li>
It can also tell you jokes. It also apologizes if you say that the joke was not funny.
  </li>
  <li>
It can also give you information about any process. For example: How to make chocolate cake.
  </li>
    <li>
There are some more minor functions that it can perform. The BOT can perform all these functions just by listening to your voice instructions. We have also created a Desktop GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the BOT.

### Built With
This project coded in [python](https://docs.python.org/3/) programming language.
<br>
<h4>Major Technologies used in the project are:-</h4>
<br>
[Speech Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/):For taking voice commands from user as input, we used speech recognition through which we can convert our voice signals into text messages using Google voice to text package.
<br><br>
      <b>Sapi5:</b>  Sapi5 is the inbuilt voice package installed in windows. It provides us with 2 voices. We can use either of them in our BOT.
<br><br>
      <b>Web Scrapping:</b> For implemeting features like weather forecast and news headlines, we used web scraping in which we used Bs4 and request modules to import data from web.
<br><br>
      <b>PyQt5 and QtDesigner:</b> This is used to create a graphical user interface for our BOT. 
<br><br>
      <b>Smart Python  Libraries:</b>  Though we have used several libraries, but some major ones are:-
<br>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          Pywhatkit: For sending Whatsaap messages.
        <li>
          SMTPLIB: For sending email messages.
        <li>
          Pyjokes: For adding Joke feature.
        <li>
          PyAutoGui: For automating features like volume up and volume down
